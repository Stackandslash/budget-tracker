### Details
This app tracks financial entries by the customer, and arranges the information in a table and chart. The page will accept a name for the entry, and a dollar amount, which will be recorded. The included graph will then display your financial history recorded thus far.

* Only one expense can be added at a time.

* This app also includes excellent graphing, provided by the course. My work on this app is strictly database-focused, and working out what I needed to add from the existing front-end.


### Issues
While you can use this app to track quite reliably, there are a few features that could be improved with future iterations:

* More robust entry options may be desired. Multiple associated entries, entry categories, and other details may help in tracking accounts.

* Once entered, transactions cannot currently be deleted.
